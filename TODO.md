- write blog post
    - HN comment threads are NOT ergonomic. they disproportionately weight the "left edge" of the tree, and siblings are starved of attention. i also care more about distinct participants in a sub-convo, not sheer comments.
    - this is also just a generic way to seed generative discourse around any topic (not just an HN topic)
    - for example, I had the tool generate a mock payload, and it actually did it around the topic of my tool idea and the fake discussion and discourse blew me away
- share on Reddit, HN (LinkedIn?)

- bookmarked comments feature
    - small icon button on each comment
    - stored in localstorage
    - bookmarks saved as (story ID, comment ID, date?)
    - at app level, a bookmarks tab that shows all bookmarked comments across all links with bookmarks. min-win is it opens the story on HN itself
    - (optional) at story level, a way to search for bookmarked content (could reuse search logic)
